        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>
          For the past couple of decades, the world has changed in so many ways. One of them, the Digital Era, has deeply impacted the way we travel, eat, sleep, date, but above all how we think and communicate. The roots on which every human being was standing have been shuffled, leaving us facing several new challenges. How should we move forward? Which ethics should we follow to make things right? What services could we build to help people live in this new world, being able to enjoy basic and decent human rights? How can we drastically reduce energy consumption to limit the greenhouse effect? What can we do to give a proper education to anyone in the globe? These are some of the topics and thoughts that drive the way I chose how to hopefully live a meaningful life on a daily basis.

        <h3>What am I currently doing?</h3>
        <p>
          I’m a full-stack software engineer and freelancer based in Paris, France. I’m currently working with Spendesk, a startup that disrupts the way to manage team expenses, without having to lend out the company card or fill out expense reports. I also worked with MFG Labs, a startup / digital agency that provides ways to tackle challenges with data exploration and machine learning. Finally, I worked with Hublo, where we had the chance to integrate the YCombinator’s S14 batch in Mountain View, California.

        <h3>What's my technical stack?</h3>
        <p>
          I love working with frontend technologies such as React, Redux, Backbone, Angular and SASS, playing around with Gulp and Webpack to improve my workflow. The rest of the time, I enjoy working with NodeJS, Ruby and more recently Scala and Python. I’m also fond of Functional Programming, algorithmic patterns and I quite enjoy reading papers about Machine Learning. Finally, I’m always interested to read news about the startup business ecosystem and its potential impact on billion of lives.

        <h3>Last few words</h3>
        <p>
          When I’m not working, I deeply love spending time diving into arts, visiting museums and reading. I also love TED talks, Meetups and Medium posts. If you want to chat, feel free to drop me a few lines <a class="link" href="mailto:pierre.guilhou@hetic.net">here</a> or take a look at my resume <a href="CV.pdf" class="link">here</a>.
